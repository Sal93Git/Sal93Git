👋 Weclome to my GitHub page, I'm Sal
  
Driving automation and reliability in production by day 🔧 , experimenting with indie games by night 🎮 .

With experience across DevOps, SRE, and Test Automation, I’ve helped teams improve delivery pipelines, boost system reliability, and build automation frameworks that make software delivery faster and smoother.

I’m always chasing new skills, whether it’s tools, engines, DevOps practices, or AI — anything that helps me level up and keep learning.
